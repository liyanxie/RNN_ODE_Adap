# RNN-ODE with Adaptive Time Steps

This repo contains the official implementation for the paper **[Neural Differential Recurrent Neural Networks with Adaptive Time Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01674)** \
by Yixuan Tan, [Liyan Xie](https://liyanxie.github.io/), and [Xiuyuan Cheng](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~xiuyuanc/).


We propose an RNN-ODE model with adaptive time steps, called RNN-ODE-Adap, that uses a RNN-ODE to represent the time development of the hidden states, and we adaptively select time steps based on the steepness of changes of the data over time so as to train the model more efficiently for the ``spike-like'' time series (see examples below).

In the left panel, the subsequences enclosed with the orange, yellow, and green brackets represent the (training or testing) windows generated from this sequence. The rightmost plot shows the binary event series data with the underlying intensity function of this non-homogenous Poisson process.</em>

The basic idea of adaptive time steps is captured in the figure below:

## What does this code do?

This codebase contains functions needed for implementing RNN-ODE-Adap, and provide the code for reproducing the spiral example used in the paper, as shown below.
